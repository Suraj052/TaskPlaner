# TaskPlaner
The Todo Website is a simple and intuitive web application designed to help users manage their tasks and stay organised. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and organising to-do items, allowing users to easily track their progress and prioritise their tasks.

## Features

- Add: You can easily add new tasks to your Todo list. Simply enter the task details and click the "Add Task" button.
- Delete: If you no longer need a task, you can delete it from your list by clicking the delete icon associated with that task.
- Update: You have the flexibility to update the details of any task. Click on the edit icon of the task you want to modify, make the necessary changes, and click the "Update Task" button.
- Mark as Completed: Once you finish a task, you can mark it as completed. This helps you keep track of your progress.
- Local Storage: The website utilizes local storage to store your Todo list data. This ensures that your data remains persistent even if you refresh the page or close the browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
